# Hashicorp Vault example

This example deploys a server of [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault).

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/hashicorp-vault)

## ✨ Features

- Hashicorp Vault

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Click the Railway button 👆
- Fill in the variables
- Deploy! 🚄

## ⚠️ Development mode

Running in development mode (`ENV=dev`) uses in-memory storage. **Redeploying or upgrading the Vault version will erase all data.**

To avoid data loss, use [medusa](https://github.com/jonasvinther/medusa) to export your secrets before upgrading and re-import them afterward.

## 🔐 Security note: `disable_mlock` is enabled

This template sets `disable_mlock: true` in the Vault config. Here is what that means and why:

- Vault normally calls [`mlock(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html) to pin its process memory in RAM, preventing the kernel from paging memory containing secrets (encryption keys, tokens, secret values) to swap on disk.
- `mlock` requires the Linux `IPC_LOCK` capability. Railway does **not** currently expose a way to grant additional Linux capabilities to a container (the `capabilities` field is not part of the [Railway config schema](https://backboard.railway.app/railway.schema.json)), so Vault cannot acquire `IPC_LOCK` and `mlock` would fail.
- Disabling `mlock` is the official Vault workaround when the capability is unavailable. See [HashiCorp's guidance](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/configuration#disable_mlock).

### What's the practical impact?

If the underlying host has swap enabled and is under memory pressure, sensitive Vault memory pages **could** be written to a swap file. Recovering keys from swap would require an attacker to obtain disk-level access to the host. On Railway's managed infrastructure end users do not have access to host disks, so the realistic exposure is mainly to Railway's platform itself.

If you need stronger guarantees (regulated workloads, high-value secrets), do not run this template on Railway as-is — deploy Vault on infrastructure where you can grant `IPC_LOCK` (Kubernetes with `securityContext.capabilities`, plain Docker with `--cap-add IPC_LOCK`, or a host with swap disabled).
